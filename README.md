# Dug-Up-Gordon
## Dug Up Gordon is a simple ASCII game. That takes place in someone's backyard, you work as a seed picker. Use W, A, S, D to move. Avoid hitting the walls tho! :)
---
# How to play
1. The "@" is Gordon
2. "*" means you dug up the seeds.
3. "." means the seeds you didn't dug up
4. "#" means that is an obstacle don't hit it!
5. The "|" and "-" are the walls don't hit it
6. "X" is your VAN and that will finish the game
7. Once you gather all of the seeds go to the "X" marker.
8. DONE!
---
## Bumping the obstacles and the wall will reset the game.

# How to build the .cpp file
---
1. Open your C++ IDE
2. Open the main.cpp file inside the "Code" folder
3. If you're using DEV-C++ like I do you can just open "Dug Up Gordon.dev"
4. Build it and a file will come out named "main.exe" that's the game
5. You can modify the size of the map by changing the printing property and replacing the x and y axis.
